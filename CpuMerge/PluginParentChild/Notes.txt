Initialize(ref IntPtr data, IntPtr rm)
- Called when a measure is created

Reload(IntPtr data, IntPtr rm, ref double maxValue): 
- If DynamicVariables=1 is set on the measure, this is called just before every call to the Update function during the update cycle. (Otherwise, only just between Initialize and Update.)

Finalize(IntPtr data): 
- Called by Rainmeter when a measure is about to be destroyed. Perform cleanup here.

IntPtr GetString(IntPtr data)
- Usable to get MeasurePath:
[DllExport]
public static IntPtr GetString(IntPtr data)
{
	// Return a string value (must be marshalled)
	return Marshal.StringToHGlobalUni("SomeValue");
}
- Will be used as measure value
